        description : "NHL puck line bets are a type of wager that involves a point spread specific to hockey. In puck line betting, the sportsbook assigns a handicap to the favorite team and an advantage to the underdog. The point spread is typically set at 1.5 goals, although it can vary depending on the matchup and sportsbook. The favorite is listed at -1.5, while the underdog is listed at +1.5. Puck line bets can offer an alternative to traditional moneyline bets, allowing for potentially higher payouts if you correctly predict the margin of victory. However, keep in mind that the odds on puck line bets may be adjusted to reflect the point spread, meaning that favorites on the puck line will have lower odds compared to the moneyline.
